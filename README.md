Media Search App enables us to search the related images of any topic we want.

It uses API to call the images. This is an improvement over my last App(See here : https://github.com/pratikthakur2003/MemeShare-App).

I have used RecyclerView feature to enable vertical scrolling so that multiple Images can be shown.

Chrome Custom Tabs feature has also been implemented here in order to access the Source of the images directly in the App without having to open Chrome Browser.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to share it.
